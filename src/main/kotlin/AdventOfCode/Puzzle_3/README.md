01111
00111
11100
10000
11001
00010
01010
```

# Puzzle 1 
Calculate the Gamma rate and epsilon rate from the data
```
Gamma = binary number made up of the most common value at that position eg 10110
horizontal =  binary number made up of the least common value at that position eg 01001
```
### What value do you get multiplying the gamma and epilson rate?
